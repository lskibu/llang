### llang
A parser for the L programming language
I am writing the software for pleasure
and skill development! 

##### TO-DO steps
I wrote the lexer only for now which was not a big deal
To do next is writing a manual parser for the llang 
that as a result constructs an A-syntax-tree to analyze
then transform it into object code later....

- For this year, I will do the parser only and maybe semantic analyzer,
then I take pause till next one... I am not totally free for writing that
project alone. But I will finish it one day and L lang will come to life.
